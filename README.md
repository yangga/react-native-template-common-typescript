## :star: Features

- Elegant usage directly within the [React Native CLI](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli)
- It supports draw-navigation or tab-navigation styles

## :arrow_forward: Usage

### Note on the legacy CLI

There seems to be quite some confusion about the legacy CLI. This template only works with the new CLI. Make sure you have uninstalled the legacy `react-native-cli` first (`npm uninstall -g react-native-cli`), for the above command to work. If you wish to not use `npx`, you can also install the new CLI globally (`npm i -g @react-native-community/cli` or `yarn global add @react-native-community/cli`).

Further information can be found here: https://github.com/react-native-community/cli#about
